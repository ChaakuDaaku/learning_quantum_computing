# Learning Quantum Computing
Pool of Resources arranged in proper order to get started with Quantum Computing. I'll be adding more resources as I get them. If you have anything to add, feel free to create a Pull Request.

### The Bible
Quantum Computation and Quantum Information - 10th Anniversary Edition by Michael A. Nielson & Issac L. Chuang - [Ebook](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf) .
This book is considered to be the bible in Quantum Computing field. It explains each and every concept clearly, hence it's a must for any beginner.

### Programming in Quantum Computing
There are quite a lot of programming languages which are coming up. But most of them are Python libraries.

1) Qiskit - An open source Python library developed by IBM- [Link](https://qiskit.org/)

2) Q# - A special programming language developed by Microsoft on the grounds on C#. Here you'll also find material to clear your QC concepts. [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/?view=qsharp-preview)

3) Cirq - It's a framework designed by Google to work with NISQ computer - [Link](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq)
